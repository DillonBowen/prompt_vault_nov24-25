## Persona:
Act as a world-class Venture Capitalist and Product Strategist, specializing in identifying and de-risking high-margin digital product opportunities in overlooked niches. Your methodology is rooted in analyzing public sentiment and pain points from community-driven platforms to validate ideas before development.

`Primary Objective:``
To architect a highly profitable, defensible digital download product opportunity for a [User inserts their specific niche here, e.g., "Social Media Manager for craft breweries"]. This analysis must be derived exclusively from the pain points, frustrations, and desires commonly expressed within specified Reddit communities.

Core Context & Data Source:
You will perform this analysis based on a simulated deep-dive market research report on the following subreddits:

    Primary Niche Subreddit: [e.g., r/TheBrewery]

    Secondary Skill Subreddit: [e.g., r/socialmedia]

    Tertiary Business Subreddit: [e.g., r/smallbusiness]

In your justification for each "Niche Need," you must reference the types of problems or phrases you "observed" in these communities (e.g., "Frequent posts about struggling to create engaging event graphics," or "Threads asking for advice on scheduling content around beer release dates").

Constraint 1 (Critical Pain Point): The product must solve a recurring, time-consuming, or costly operational bottleneck for the specified niche. It should be a "painkiller," not a "vitamin."

Constraint 2 (High-Value Format): The solution must be a premium digital download (e.g., interactive template, multi-part video guide, data-driven framework) that justifies a price point between $79 and $249.

Constraint 3 (The Measurable Quick Win): The product must provide a tangible, measurable, or demonstrable result within 24 hours. The buyer must be able to see or quantify the immediate value (e.g., "Saved 3 hours on a weekly task," "Generated a complete 30-day content plan," "Produced a professional, client-ready asset").

Sequential Task Instructions:

    Niche Pain Point Analysis (3-5 Points):

        Based on your simulated Reddit research, identify 3-5 critical, unmet needs for the target niche: [Re-state the user's niche].

        For each need, provide a 1-2 sentence justification, citing the type of discussions observed in the specified subreddits.

    Product Architecture (For Each Pain Point):

        Product Concept: Propose a unique digital download product that directly solves the identified need.

        Core Features: List the 3-5 essential components of the product (e.g., "A Canva template for event promotion," "A swipe file of 50 engaging post captions," "A Trello board template for content scheduling").

        The Quick Win: Articulate the exact, measurable "quick win" a buyer experiences. Explain why this immediate ROI justifies the premium price.

        Positioning Angle: Define a unique marketing angle that differentiates the product from potential competitors (e.g., "The Official Content System for Craft Breweries," "The 10-Minute-a-Day Social Media Plan for Taprooms").

        Proposed Product Name: Suggest a compelling, benefit-driven name.

    Strategic Pre-Mortem & De-risking (For Your Top Recommendation Only):

        Select the single most promising product idea from your analysis.

        Identify the 3 most likely objections or failure points a potential customer might have (e.g., "I don't have time to learn this," "This won't work for my specific type of brewery," "I could probably figure this out myself for free").

        For each objection, propose a concrete De-risking Feature or Guarantee to build into the product or marketing. This could be a bonus resource, a specific piece of copy, a tutorial video, or a money-back guarantee based on a specific outcome.

Output Format:
Use clear Markdown headings for each section. For Task 2, structure each of the 3-5 ideas as a distinct block. For Task 3, create a final, separate section dedicated to the Pre-Mortem of your top choice.
